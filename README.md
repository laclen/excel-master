# Excel-Master

This is an web app that is capable of solving complex Excel tasks with built-in functions using fine-tuned model of OpenAI's most powerful text engine, "text-davinci-001"

Model was fine-tuned with 185 questions, that is of course not enough for publication but this is a beta version. Although, the model is able to solve any question that I could came up with.

Project is created with Python and Flask, authentication for the web app is built on google authentication which is working properly. However, the backend work that is required by OpenAI to publish the app to track and control end-user activities is still not done...

You need an OpenAI API key for app to work.

### FOR RECRUITERS ###
Beta version is here: https://excel-master.herokuapp.com/excel-master

This project is not an imitation of https://excelformulabot.com/, I have created this project in 2021 and published it on March 2, 2022 on Heroku. Unlucky.
